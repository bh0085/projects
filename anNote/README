anNote seeks to become a vertical solution for dealing with scanned notes.

Its functionality includes:

1) Downloading attachements from all email addresses reaching a certain gmail address as pdfs.

2) Shepherding pdfs into png files and extracting an outline layer. (Blue ink in the current implementation)

3) Breaking the outline into blocks of text for transcription. Blocks of text may have tags such as:
   	TIT, PP, TAG, RS, Q

4) Queueing transcription blocks for a given so that the user may tag them at her leisure. Then mapping transcribed blocks back onto the original image.

5) Integrating everything with keepnote. Extracting, TIT for e.g as note titles, PP as paper crossreferences, RS as research cross references.


1,2 are done in 'attachments.py' and 'mailman.py'. 
3,4 have bugs (text is upside down and block bounds are apparently not computed correctly although clustering works fine) and are partially implemented in 'mailman.py'.
5 is not yet begun. For a note on how to build new keepnote extensions though, see the extension that I build... "addnote"?
