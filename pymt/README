This project is just a stub for the mechanical turk library that I hope to build.

At this point, I have an account and have downloaded mechanical turk.

Inside of 'all_tests.py' resides line to run the doctests from the boto source. Insides of 'tests.py' resides a bunch of scripts to test the mechanical turk API from AWS. Right now, it is configured in the code to use the developer sandbox so that everything is free.

The script, make_hit doesn't work just yet. Some problem with XML syntax that may be caused by my omission of a urlencoding or the unneeded addition of a urlencoding somewhere. I think that the 'QUESTION' parameter is currently not urlencoded whereas some other params may be?
