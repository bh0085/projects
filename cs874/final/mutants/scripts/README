These python programs were written by P. Clote to create an
image of the mutation profile discussed in the paper, 
"RNAmutants: A web server to explore the mutational landscape
of RNA secondary structures", by J. Waldispuhl, S. Devadas, B.Berger
and P. Clote, PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Aug 8;4(8):e1000124.
They are provided as is, with no guarantees whatsoever.

To properly generate the mutational profile, as displayed in this
article, you must download RNAmutants source code, and then
execute the command:

  RNAmutants --library libraryPath --input-string $1 --mutation $2 \
             --sample-command sampleCommands.txt

Here "libraryPath" is the full path to the library files of MFOLD
free energy parameters from M. Zuker's software. The "input-string"
is a user-given RNA sequence, "mutation" is the maximum number of
mutations allowed, and the file with name "sampleCommands.txt"
contains information on how many sequence-structures should be sampled
for each mutation k, where k is bounded by the user-specified maximum
number of mutations allowed. 

For instance, in order to produce the mutational profile in the paper,
my file "sampleCommands.txt" contained the following:
1       100
2       100
3       100
4       100
5       100
6       100
7       100
8       100
9       100
10      100
11      100
12      100
13      100
14      100
15      100

The output consisted of 100 sequence-structures sampled for each fixed
number of mutations k, for 1<=k<=15.

The python programs in this directory then were used to process the output
to create the mutational profile.
